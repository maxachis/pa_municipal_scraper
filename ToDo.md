# Major To-Do
* Refactor code to generally be cleaner
* Refactor code to include random delays between actions, to simulate human behavior
* Move MuniFinExtractor to its own script

# Maybe
* For clarity, maybe move MuniDemo and PoliceDetails excel files to outputs
* Maybe develop scripts to pull MuniDemo and PoliceDetails. Not necessarily super necessary, however, as it takes basically two clicks to download each, and the data would realistically likely only update once a year.
